## change / RobustGaSP 0.5.6
 *Implement two functions called simulate() and plot() to replace Sample() and Plot() functions, respectively.
 *Reimplemented the demo-functions, including higdon.1.data(), limetal.2.data(), dettepepel.3.data(), borehole() and friedman.5.data()
 *The license is modified to GPL-2 | GPL-3. 
 *change the slight typo of the reference prior when the emulator has zero mean 
 *Add two references. The main paper is recently published in Annals of Statistics and another paper is on arXiv.

## RobustGaSP 0.5.5
 * Update the maximum num of evaluation in the optimizer by nloptr::lbfgs(). The maximum num of evaluation should increase with the increase of the dimension of the inputs
 * Implement leave_one_out_rgasp() function for model checking
 * Allow user to choose whether we use an S3 or S4 method for prediction


## RobustGaSP 0.5.4
  * Add the choice of the zero mean GaSP
  * Change the setting of nloptr to be nl.info=F.  Delete sink()
  * Correct printing of the noise

## change / RobustGaSP 0.5.2
  * Bugs corrected in rgasp() about the sink() function when the optimization step fails
  * Typo corrected in printing out the nugget value after the optimization is done
  * Allow the argument design in rgasp() to be initialized as a sequence (previously it has to be the matrix type)
  * Change of the maintainer’s Email address


## change / RobustGaSP 0.5
  * Implement a function ‘findInertInputs’ to identify inert inputs
  * Implement a function ‘Sample’ to sample from the predictive distribution
  * Modify the printing information of the function ‘rgasp’ by removing the automatic printing message from the function of ‘nloptr::lbfgs’ and adding other printing information
  * Change the parameter ‘beta’ to ‘beta_hat’ in rgasp class
  * Fix the bug in the function ‘predict’ of the value ‘sd’
